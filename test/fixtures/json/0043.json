More than 200,000 people are hospitalized for flurelated complications each year; 63% are 65 or older (CDC 2009; Thompson et al. 2004). The health impact of influenza on older adults is substantial and flu short vaccines are the most effective way to prevent severe illness complications and death. This measure facilitates efforts toward infectious disease prevention among a vulnerable subgroup of the population.",
